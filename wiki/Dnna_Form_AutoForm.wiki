The Dnna_Form_AutoForm class is a Zend_Form extension that ties directly to a model class and automatically creates form elements based on the model's properties. The goal is to allow the developer to leverage the benefits of Zend_Form while remaining DRY in simple form applications.

The elements and their behavior can be controlled through annotations, and the form can be directly populated using an object instance.
